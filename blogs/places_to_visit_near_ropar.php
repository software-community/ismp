					<p>I don’t know if people would consider it a place worth visiting or not but for me its surely a bliss and I would surely recommend everyone to visit the beautiful place once. No matter, if it’s the happy time after the exams or the times of sadness when I wished for solace, canal is always an extremely close option for me each and every time. The tranquility and peace it have to offer is immense and those deep moments of self introspection are great. Enjoying the sunset at the canal with friends and music and some nice food packagings are sufficient to complete my day on a happy note. On the whole, just a bus to tc and 5-10 minutes walk is enough for any mood for me.</p>

						Punjab boasts of its wealth and elegance through its diverse culture while also reminding us of the land’s humility through its memoirs and pious shrines. An excellent combination of the two is the district of Fatehgarh Sahib. Every year during the month of December, the Shaheedi Jor Mela is organised at the Gurudwara Fatehgarh Sahib to pay homage to the young Sahibzadas who lay down their lives while fighting injustice. It is considered to be one of the biggest festivities of the State and people from all across the country come to be part of it. Fatehgarh Sahib is about an hour’s drive away from Ropar and buses are easily available. This might just become one of the many reasons to stay back at the campus during your vacations!

						Remember the Manali trek from Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani? Well, the Triund trek isn't exactly like it but, of course, not a bad option too, to experience the beautiful snow-covered peaks and profound valleys. Triund is one of the easiest Himalayan treks with less expense and enduring participation. With a campfire in the night and surrounded by mountains, you will never want to leave the place that's filled with serenity and breathtaking views. And the best part! a dog will always be following you, making your journey a little more special!

						You all might have heard college life is incomplete without some unforgettable and adventurous trips and Ropar is surrounded by beautiful places to visit. Talking of the surroundings of Ropar we don't even need to think where to start from, yes of course we are talking of "Chandigarh- rightly known as the city beautiful".
					</p>
					<p>
						Chandigarh is the best-planned city in India, with architecture which is world-renowned, and a quality of life, which is unparalleled. The face of modern India, Chandigarh, is the manifestation of a dream that Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru envisaged and Le Corbusier executed.
					</p>
					<p>
						But you need to know what places of interest is the city endowed with. As a first time visitor one is fascinated by the tourist attractions like the Rock Garden, Rose Garden, Sukhna Lake, Chhatbir Zoo, Elante Mall, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hereby i will provide you a glimpse of the city that awaits your presence: See the intricate work done at the Rock Garden which adds to its resplendence:
					</p>
					<p>
						The Sukhna Lake will surely be a retreat for eyes and the peace garden would replenish your soul.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ones from Chandigarh would know the grandeur associated with Secor 17 plaza before the existence of malls in the city.
					</p>

						The Elante Mall came up as one of the biggest malls in the city and has brands to serve all your interests. It has lately become the meet up place for residents just adding to the city's splendor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Last but not the least Chandigarh is known as the Clean and Green city so why not mention about Rose Garden which exhibits beautiful flora and holds a great annual event the Rose Festival.
					</p>
					<p>
						So just a long weekend is awaited and you may have a tour of the marvellous city just a few kilometers away from our college.
					</p>
					<p>
						Welcome to Ropar

						"Wow I got admitted to IIT Ropar it was one of my top choices in Josaa. "
					</p>

					</p>

						I know that all you freshers can surely relate to one of the above categories. Whether you were here by choice or not but we assure you that your future is secure once you have joined this institution. So no need to worry about anything and just explore "Life At Ropar".
